    "In 2014, I was taking a year off from my undergraduate degree to manage a family crisis and staying with my parents in St. Louis, MO. I grew up middle class in the \"inner city\" of St. Louis, and it was impossible to escape the legacy of white flight and discrimination that I saw everywhere I looked. No one trusted the cops.\n",

    "However, I remember being shocked by Ferguson. Not by the sentiments being expressed, but by the fact that long-simmering greivances had blown up in such dramatic fashion. My family lives next to a large city business district, and the protests came down to our neighborhood. One night, the cops fired tear gas into a coffee shop down the street, and it blew into our backyard. I had been told to return home from my job in a nearby restaurant by the riot police, and I was watching from my window as it all played out.\n",

    "\"The Post is documenting only those shootings in which a police officer, in the line of duty, shoots and kills a civilian — the circumstances that most closely parallel the 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., which began the protest movement culminating in Black Lives Matter and an increased focus on police accountability nationwide. The Post is not tracking deaths of people in police custody, fatal shootings by off-duty officers or non-shooting deaths.\n",
