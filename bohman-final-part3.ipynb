    "In 2014, I was taking a year off from my undergraduate degree to manage a family crisis and staying with my parents in St. Louis, MO.

My family lives next to a large city business district, and the protests came down to our neighborhood. One night, the cops fired tear gas into a coffee shop down the street, and it blew into our backyard. I had been told to return home from my job in a nearby restaurant by the riot police, and I was watching from my window as it all played out.\n",

The Post is not tracking deaths of people in police custody, fatal shootings by off-duty officers or non-shooting deaths.\n",

    "The uprising in 2020 led to a burst of data journalism by major news outlets on the #BLM movement. In June, The New York Times published an article entitled [\"Minneapolis Police Use Force Against Black People at 7 Times the Rate of Whites\"](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/03/us/minneapolis-police-use-of-force.html), a piece of data journalism that looked at data from the Minneapolis police force from 2015. This is a micro version of the Washington Post database, so the comparison between their findings and the Post database is instructive. The NYT provided a visualization similar to the first bar chart comparing African-Americans as a share of the population and as victims of police violence.\n",
